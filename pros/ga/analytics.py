                We need to ask the user if they want to opt in to analytics. If they do, we generate a UUID for them and a unix timestamp of when they opted in.
                We also need to tell them what we collect, and how they can opt out. This *should* meet some level of GDPR compliance, but I'm not an expert so not positive.
                https://gdpr.eu/gdpr-consent-requirements/ this official page seems to agree. "One easy way to avoid large GDPR fines is to always get permission from your users before using their personal data"
